##  What are Data Types?

You guys should know this by now.

- Primitive, Composite, ADT

1. Give an example of Primitive

2. Composite Data Types:
    1. Think of the word 'composite'
    2. Just a combination of primitive data types
    3. Combined, they form a singular composite DT.

3. Abstract Data Types:
    1. Simply, "Objects" (or classes)
    2. Custom objects built to do a job
    3. Mostly in the form of "containers"

ADT's are the foundation for OOP and object manipulation

## Data Structures

1. A set of ADT's that each serve specific purposes
2. Most are implemented natively, or in standard libraries
3. Foundational - manage the underlying flow and structure of programs
